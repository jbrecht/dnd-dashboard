            "description": "<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Almost all of the common people and other folk that one might encounter along the Sword Coast or in the North have one thing in common: they live out their lives without ever traveling more than a few miles from where they <span class=\"No-Break\">were born.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You aren’t one of t<span class=\"No-Break\">hose folk.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You are from a distant place, one so remote that few of the common folk in the North realize that it exists, and chances are good that even if some people you meet have heard of your homeland, they know merely the name and perhaps a few outrageous stories. You have come to this part of Faer&ucirc;n for your own reasons, which you might or might not choose<span class=\"No-Break\"> to share.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body--Extra-Space-After-\">Although you will undoubtedly find some of this land’s ways to be strange and discomfiting, you can also be sure that some things its people take for granted will be to you new wonders that you’ve never laid eyes on before. By the same token, you’re a person of interest, for good or ill, to those around you almost anywhe<span class=\"No-Break\">re you go.</span></p>\r\n<div class=\"line character height1 marginTop20 marginBottom20\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Hanging\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Skill Proficiencies:</span></strong>&nbsp;Insight, <span class=\"No-Break\">Perception<br /></span><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Tool Proficiencies:</span></strong> Any one musical instrument or gaming set of your choice, likely something native to you<span class=\"No-Break\">r homeland<br /></span><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Languages:</span></strong> Any one of y<span class=\"No-Break\">our choice<br /></span><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Equipment:</span></strong> One set of traveler’s clothes, any one musical instrument or gaming set you are proficient with, poorly wrought maps from your homeland that depict where you are in Faer&ucirc;n, a small piece of jewelry worth 10 gp in the style of your homeland’s craftsmanship, and a pouch conta<span class=\"No-Break\">ining 5 gp</span></p>\r\n<div class=\"line character height1 marginTop20 marginBottom20\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Why Are You Here?</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">A far traveler might have set out on a journey for one of a number of reasons, and the departure from his or her homeland could have been voluntary or involuntary. To determine why you are so far from home, roll on the table below or choose from the options provided. The following section, discussing possible homelands, includes some suggested reasons that are appropriate for each<span class=\"No-Break\"> location.</span></p>\r\n<table>\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>d6</th>\r\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Reason</th>\r\n<th>d6</th>\r\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Reason</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>1</td>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Emissary</td>\r\n<td>4</td>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Pilgrim</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>2</td>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Exile</td>\r\n<td>5</td>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Sightseer</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>3</td>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Fugitive</td>\r\n<td>6</td>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Wanderer</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<div class=\"line character height1 marginTop20 marginBottom20\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Where Are You From?</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The most important decision in creating a far traveler background is determining your homeland. The places discussed here are all sufficiently distant from the North and the Sword Coast to justify the use of this b<span class=\"No-Break\">ackground.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Evermeet.</span></strong> The fabled elven islands far to the west are home to elves who have never been to Faer&ucirc;n. They often find it a harsher place than they expected when they do make the trip. If you are an elf, Evermeet is a logical (though not mandatory) choice for your<span class=\"No-Break\"> homeland.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Most of those who emigrate from Evermeet are either exiles, forced out for committing some infraction of elven law, or emissaries who come to Faer&ucirc;n for a purpose that benefits elven culture o<span class=\"No-Break\">r society.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Halruaa.</span></strong> Located on the southern edges of the Shining South, and hemmed in by mountains all around, the magocracy of Halruaa is a bizarre land to most in Faer&ucirc;n who know about it. Many folk have heard of the strange skyships the Halruaans sail, and a few know of the tales that even the least of their people can w<span class=\"No-Break\">ork magic.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Halruaans usually make their journeys into Faer&ucirc;n for personal reasons, since their government has a strict stance against unauthorized involvement with other nations and organizations. You might have been exiled for breaking one of Halruaa’s many byzantine laws, or you could be a pilgrim who seeks the shrines of the gods<span class=\"No-Break\"> of magic.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Kara-Tur.</span></strong> The continent of Kara-Tur, far to the east of Faer&ucirc;n, is home to people whose customs are unfamiliar to the folk of the Sword Coast. If you come from Kara-Tur, the people of Faer&ucirc;n likely refer to you as Shou, even if that isn’t your true ethnicity, because that’s the blanket term they use for everyone who shares yo<span class=\"No-Break\">ur origin.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The folk of Kara-Tur occasionally travel to Faer&ucirc;n as diplomats or to forge trade relations with prosperous merchant cartels. You might have come here as part of some such delegation, then decided to stay when the mission<span class=\"No-Break\"> was over.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Mulhorand.</span></strong> From the terrain to the architecture to the god-kings who rule over these lands, nearly everything about Mulhorand is alien to someone from the Sword Coast. You likely experienced the same sort of culture shock when you left your desert home and traveled to the unfamiliar climes of northern Faer&ucirc;n. Recent events in your homeland have led to the abolition of slavery, and a corresponding increase in the traffic between Mulhorand and the distant parts <span class=\"No-Break\">of Faer&ucirc;n.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Those who leave behind Mulhorand’s sweltering deserts and ancient pyramids for a glimpse at a different life do so for many reasons. You might be in the North simply to see the strangeness this wet land has to offer, or because you have made too many enemies among the desert communities of <span class=\"No-Break\">your home.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Sossal.</span></strong> Few have heard of your homeland, but many have questions about it upon seeing you. Humans from Sossal seem crafted from snow, with alabaster skin and white hair, and typically dressed<span class=\"No-Break\"> in white.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Sossal exists far to the northeast, hard up against the endless ice to the north and bounded on its other sides by hundreds of miles of the Great Glacier and the Great Ice Sea. No one from your nation makes the effort to cross such colossal barriers without a convincing reason. You must fear something truly terrible or seek something incredibly <span class=\"No-Break\">important.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Zakhara.</span></strong> As the saying goes among those in Faer&ucirc;n who know of the place, &ldquo;To get to Zakhara, go south. Then go south some more.&rdquo; Of course, you followed an equally long route when you came north from your place of birth. Though it isn’t unusual for Zakharans to visit the southern extremes of Faer&ucirc;n for trading purposes, few of them stray as far from home as<span class=\"No-Break\"> you have.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You might be traveling to discover what wonders are to be found outside the deserts and sword-like mountains of your homeland, or perhaps you are on a pilgrimage to understand the gods that others worship, so that you might better appreciate your ow<span class=\"No-Break\">n deities.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">The </span><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Underdark.</span></strong> Though your home is physically closer to the Sword Coast than the other locations discussed here, it is far more unnatural. You hail from one of the settlements in the Underdark, each of which has its own strange customs and laws. If you are a native of one of the great subterranean cities or settlements, you are probably a member of the race that occupies the place&mdash;but you might also have grown up there after being captured and brought below when you wer<span class=\"No-Break\">e a child.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you are a true Underdark native, you might have come to the surface as an emissary of your people, or perhaps to escape accusations of criminal behavior (whether warranted or not). If you aren’t a native, your reason for leaving &ldquo;home&rdquo; probably has something to do with getting away from a bad <span class=\"No-Break\">situation.</span></p>\r\n<div class=\"line character height1 marginTop20 marginBottom20\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Feature: All Eyes on You</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your accent, mannerisms, figures of speech, and perhaps even your appearance all mark you as foreign. Curious glances are directed your way wherever you go, which can be a nuisance, but you also gain the friendly interest of scholars and others intrigued by far-off lands, to say nothing of everyday folk who are eager to hear stories of your<span class=\"No-Break\"> homeland.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can parley this attention into access to people and places you might not otherwise have, for you and your traveling companions. Noble lords, scholars, and merchant princes, to name a few, might be interested in hearing about your distant homeland a<span class=\"No-Break\">nd people.<br /></span></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<h5 class=\"line character height1 marginTop20 marginBottom20\">&nbsp;Suggested Characteristics&nbsp;</h5>\r\n<table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\">\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>d6</th>\r\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Personality Trait</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>1</td>\r\n<td>I have different assumptions from those around me concerning personal space, blithely invading others’ space in innocence, or reacting to ignorant invasion of my own.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>2</td>\r\n<td>I have my own ideas about what is and is not food, and I find the eating habits of those around me fascinating, confusing, or revolting.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>3</td>\r\n<td>I have a strong code of honor or sense of propriety that others don’t comprehend.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>4</td>\r\n<td>I express affection or contempt in ways that are unfamiliar to others.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>5</td>\r\n<td>I begin or end my day with small traditional rituals that are unfamiliar to those around me.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>6</td>\r\n<td>Sarcasm and insults are my weapons of choice.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\">\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>d6</th>\r\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Ideal</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>1</td>\r\n<td><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Open.</span> I have much to learn from the kindly folk I meet along my way.

While many young goblins delight in the torture and killing of smaller creatures, Shtur took a sober fascination in slowing and extending the death process as long as possible. He took to slowly poisoning or contriving to inflict disease upon prisoners, slaves, and ultimately other members of his goblin clan. As suspicion fell upon him, the strange and dark goblin was expelled from his village.\n\nHe wandered the wastes for some time. He took to burning, poisoning, and malnourishing himself, staying constantly on the brink of death. He eventually found himself in Thay, attracted to the legions of undead servants populating that land. It was there that a monk came across the goblin, whose physical nature was now unidentifiable beneath a dense lattice work of self-inflicted scar tissue all over his body. The monk captured Ixshtur and brought him to the Monastery of the Order of the Long Death in Thay in order to study him. \n\nIxshtur would eventually go from research subject to Initiate, covertly poisoning his own master, slowly and painfully, to death, practiced as he was in such things. Upon his master's death, the truth was uncovered. Ixshtur had murdered the monk, but had also learned nearly all of his arts through pure observation. He was a natural and the Order made him one of their own. Once properly trained, he became one of their most prized servants. \n\nIxshtur has now been sent on a mission out of Thay and to the Sword Coast of Western Faerun. The Order of the Long Death once had a monastery there and it has not been heard from in centuries. Its fate, as well as any secrets about death it may have uncovered, must be learned. As Shtur travels this strange land he uncovers a field hospital full of zombie-like humans. But unlike the undead he's encountered in Thay, these ones are not at all dead, they have arrived at the true Long Death. He learns that a gnome who is a great leader in the north, and that has been seen with undead servants of his own, seems to have produced these perfect beings. He must find this Bromrig and learn his secrets.",

Where visible, Shtur's skin is heavily scarred all over, though in a ritualistic pattern, not haphazardly. From a distance, he looks very pale skinned and wizened. If his hood and the scarf that covers his face are pulled back, it can be seen that his nose and ears have been sliced off. At this point, his true race can only be learned through dissection.\n\nIxshtur wears a large necklace over his black robes, seemingly bearing large prayer beads. These are in fact removable vials of dark glass. Inside of each, a small creature paralyzed with spider venom is slowly dying. Wrapped around his waist is a black steel chain with a sickle on one end and a weight on the other, his Kusarigama. The weight is an iron shod skull.\n \nhttp://spilledale.blogspot.com/2017/03/5e-chain-weapons.html\n"

Each side pouch can hold up to 20 pounds of material, not exceeding a volume of 2 cubic feet. The large central pouch can hold up to 8 cubic feet or 80 pounds of material. The backpack always weighs 5 pounds, regardless of its contents.</p>\r\n<p>Placing an object in the haversack follows the normal rules for interacting with objects. Retrieving an item from the haversack requires you to use an action. When you reach into the haversack for a specific item, the item is always magically on top.</p>\r\n<p>The haversack has a few limitations. If it is overloaded, or if a sharp object pierces it or tears it, the haversack ruptures and is destroyed. If the haversack is destroyed, its contents are lost forever, although an artifact always turns up again somewhere. If the haversack is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, and the haversack must be put right before it can be used again. If a breathing creature is placed within the haversack, the creature can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.</p>\r\n<p>Placing the haversack inside an extradimensional space created by a <strong>bag of holding</strong>, <strong>portable hole</strong>, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.</p>",

This weapon has reach.</p>\r\n<p>You can also make a special attack with the weighted end against any&nbsp;Medium or smaller creature, dealing no damage but forcing the target to make a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 + your Proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier). On a failed saving throw, the target is grappled. A grappled target can repeat the saving throw as an action on its turn. While a target is grappled you can continue to use the sickle end of the weapon, but it loses the reach property. Finally, you can use a chain sickle as the equivalent of a grappling hook and fifteen feet of rope.</p>\r\n<p>Credit to: spilledale.blogspot.com/2017/03/5e-chain-weapons.html</p>",

If the casting is interrupted, the scroll is not lost.</p>\r\n<p>If the spell is on your class’s spell list but of a higher level than you can normally cast, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully. The DC equals 17. On a failed check, the spell disappears from the scroll with no other effect.</p>\r\n<p>This scroll contains a 7th level spell. The spell's saving throw DC is 18 and attack bonus is +10.</p>\r\n<p>A wizard spell on a spell scroll can be copied just as spells in spellbooks can be copied.

The material body you leave behind is unconscious and in a state of suspended animation; it doesn't need food or air and doesn't age.</p>\r\n<p>Your astral body resembles your mortal form in almost every way, replicating your game statistics and possessions. The principal difference is the addition of a silvery cord that extends from between your shoulder blades and trails behind you, fading to invisibility after 1 foot. This cord is your tether to your material body. As long as the tether remains intact, you can find your way home. If the cord is cut--something that can happen only when an effect specifically states that it does--your soul and body are separated, killing you instantly.</p>\r\n<p>Your astral form can freely travel through the Astral Plane and can pass through portals there leading to any other plane. If you enter a new plane or return to the plane you were on when casting this spell, your body and possessions are transported along the silver cord, allowing you to re-enter your body as you enter the new plane. Your astral form is a separate incarnation. Any damage or other effects that apply to it have no effect on your physical body, nor do they persist when you return to it.</p>\r\n<p>The spell ends for you and your companions when you use your action to dismiss it. When the spell ends, the affected creature returns to its physical body, and it awakens.</p>\r\n<p>The spell might also end early for you or one of your companions. A successful <strong>dispel magic</strong> spell used against an astral or physical body ends the spell for that creature. If a creature's original body or its astral form drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends for that creature. If the spell ends and the silver cord is intact, the cord pulls the creature's astral form back to its body, ending its state of suspended animation.</p>\r\n<p>If you are returned to your body prematurely, your companions remain in their astral forms and must find their own way back to their bodies, usually by dropping to 0 hit points.</p>",

If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature’s thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the spell ends.</p>\r\n<p>Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.</p>\r\n<p>You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can’t see.
